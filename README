CMPUT 301 Winter 2016 Assignment 1

Hanson Le
CCID: hhle

The assignment is an android app that keeps track of a vehicle's fuel consumption. A growing log of the vehicle's fuel usage is kept. A single log holds information such as the date, type of gas, price of gas, and more. Each indvidual log can have their data edited after creation.

I did not fully complete the assignment. When force-killed, my app loses all the logs. This is because I could not get Gson to work properly. I also did not write JUnit tests for the classes.
